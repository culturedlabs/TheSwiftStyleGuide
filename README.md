# Style guide for the Swift programming language

These guidelines build on the coding style used in Apple's official references and sample codes, in particular [The Swift Programming Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/) book.

This style guide is suited for projects and collaborations and does not focus on conserving space for print and web. For that check out [The Official raywenderlich.com Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide)

## Whitespace

* Prefere indent using spaces with a tab and indent width of 4 spaces. Be sure to set this in the Xcode preferences.
* Struct, enum, class, method braces and other braces (`if`/`else`/`switch`/`while` etc.) always open on the same line as the statement but close on a new line.

```swift
struct SomeStructure {
    // structure definition goes here
}

class SomeClass {
    func someMethod() {
        // method definition goes here
    }
}
```

```swift
if user.isHappy {
    // do something
}
else {
    // do something else
}
```

* There should be exactly one blank line between methods to aid in visual clarity and organization. Whitespace within methods should separate functionality, but having too many sections in a method often means you should refactor into several methods.


### Semicolons

Swift does not require you to write a semicolon (`;`) after each statement in your code. Semicolons are required, however, if you want to write multiple separate statements on a single line.

Even so do not write multiple statements on a single line separated with semicolons.

**Preferred:**

```swift
let cat = "üê±"
println(cat)
```

**Not Preferred:**

```swift
let cat = "üê±";
println(cat);
// or
let cat = "üê±"; println(cat)
```


## Comments and Documentation

When they are needed, comments should be used to explain **why** a particular piece of code does something. Any comments that are used must be kept up-to-date or deleted.

Use the `// Mark:` tag to divide functionality into meaningful, easy-to-navigate sections (`// Mark: -` can optionally be used to provide a horizontal divider in Xcode's outline).

**For example:**

```swift
/**
*  The `ListViewController` class displays awesome stuff
*/
class ListViewController: UIViewController {
    // MARK: Types

    struct MainStoryboard {
        struct SegueIdentifiers {
            // ...
        }
    }

    // MARK: Properties

    /// Set in `configureWithListInfo(_:)`. `nil` otherwise.
    var listInfo: ListInfo?

    // ...

    // MARK: View Life Cycle

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        // ...
    }

    override func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) {
        // ...
    }

    // ...

    // MARK: Setup

    // ...

    // MARK: UIViewController Overrides

    override func setEditing(editing: Bool, animated: Bool) {
        // ...
    }

    // MARK: IBActions

    // ...

    // MARK: Convenience

    // ...
}
```

## Naming

Use descriptive names with camelCase notation. Class and structure types should have UpperCamelCase names, while method names and properties should have lowerCamelCase names to differentiate them from type names.

**Preferred:**

```swift
struct FixedLengthRange {
    var firstValue: Int
    let length: Int
}
```

**Not Preferred:**

```swift
struct fixed_lengthRange {
    var v: Int
    let LENGTH: Int
}
```

For functions and initialization methods, prefer named parameters for all arguments unless the context is very clear. Include external parameter names if it makes function calls more readable.

```swift
func arithmeticMean(numbers: Double...) -> Double
func containsCharacter(#string: String, #characterToFind: Character) -> Bool
func join(string s1: String, toString s2: String, withJoiner joiner: String = " ") -> String

// Would be called like this:
arithmeticMean(3, 8.25, 18.75)
join(string: "We", toString: "Swift", withJoiner: " ‚ù§Ô∏è ")
containsCharacter(string: "City of Hamburg", characterToFind: "x")
```


### Language

Use US English spelling to match Apple's API.

**Preferred:**

```swift
let favorite = "Swift"
let color = "orange"
```

**Not Preferred:**

```swift
let favourite = "Java"
var colour = "red"
```


## Types

Always use Swift's native types when available. Swift offers bridging to Objective-C so you can still use the full set of methods as needed.

**Preferred:**

```swift
let width = 120.0                                    // Double
let widthString = (width as NSNumber).stringValue    // String
```

**Not Preferred:**

```swift
let width: NSNumber = 120.0                          // NSNumber
let widthString: NSString = width.stringValue        // NSString
```


### Constants

Use `let`-bindings over `var`-bindings wherever possible (and when in doubt). Only use variables if you absolutely have to since immutability results in much safer and clearer code.


### Optionals

Declare variables and function return types as optionals (with `?`) in situations where a value may be absent (`nil`).

When accessing an optional value, use optional chaining as an alternative to forced unwrapping since it won't trigger a runtime error if the optional is `nil`.

```swift
delegate?.listPresenterDidChangeListLayout?(self, isInitialLayout: true)
```

Use optional binding when it's more convenient to unwrap once and perform multiple operations.

```swift
if let listItemIndex = find(presentedListItems, listItem) {
    // do many things with the listItemIndex
}
else {
    // handle nil
}
```


### Struct Initializers

Use the native Swift struct initializers rather than the legacy CGGeometry constructors.

**Preferred:**

```swift
let frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 400)
var centerPoint = CGPoint(x: 50, y: 50)
```

**Not Preferred:**

```swift
let frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 200, 400)
var centerPoint = CGPointMake(50, 50)
```

Prefer the struct-scope constants `CGRect.infiniteRect`, `CGRect.nullRect`, etc. over global constants `CGRectInfinite`, `CGRectNull`, etc. For existing variables, you can use the shorter `.zeroRect`.


### Type Inference

Because of type inference, Swift requires far fewer type declarations. Constants and variables are still explicitly typed, but much of the work of specifying their type is done for you. Type inference is particularly useful when you declare a constant or variable with an initial value. This is often done by assigning a literal value (or literal) to the constant or variable at the point that you declare it.

Therefore prefer compact code and let the compiler infer the type for a constant or variable.

**Preferred:**

```swift
let meaningOfLive = 42
var theGuide = NSData(contentsOfFile: "Don't Panic")
```

**Not Preferred:**

```swift
let meaningOfLive: Int = 42
var theGuide: NSData? = NSData(contentsOfFile: "Don't Panic")
```

**NOTE:** That implies picking descriptive names is really important.


### Syntactic Sugar

Use the syntactic sugar Swift provides for the standard library types.

```swift
let shoppingList: [String]
let airports: [String: String]
var serverResponseCode: Int?
var magicButton: UIButton!
```

**Not Preferred:**

```swift
let shoppingList: Array<String>
let airports: Dictionary<String, String>
var serverResponseCode: Optional<Int>
var magicButton: ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional<UIButton>
```


## Structures and Classes

Use a value type (struct, enum) when:
* Comparing instance data with `==` makes sense
* You want copies to have independent state
* The data will be used in code across multiple threads

Use a reference type (class) when:
* Comparing instance identity with `===` makes sense
* You want to create shared, mutable state

Examples of good candidates for structures include:
* The size of a geometric shape, perhaps encapsulating a `width` property and a `height` property, both of type `Double`.
* A way to refer to ranges within a series, perhaps encapsulating a `start` property and a `length` property, both of type `Int`.
* A point in a 3D coordinate system, perhaps encapsulating `x`, `y` and `z` properties, each of type `Double`.

In all other cases, define a class, and create instances of that class to be managed and passed by reference. In practice, this means that most custom data constructs should be classes, not structures.


### Use of Self

For conciseness, avoid using `self` since Swift does not require it to access an object's properties or invoke its methods.

Only include the explicit keyword when required by the language‚Äîfor example, in a closure, or when parameter names conflict.

```swift
struct Color {
    let red, green, blue: Double

    init(red: Double, green: Double, blue: Double) {
        self.red = red
        self.green = green
        self.blue = blue
    }

    init(white: Double) {
        red = white
        green = white
        blue = white
    }
}
```

### Protocol Conformance

When adding protocol conformance to a class, prefer extending it to adopt and conform to the new protocol. This keeps the related methods grouped together and maintains structure.

**Preferred:**

```swift
class ListViewController: UIViewController {
    // class definition goes here
}

// MARK: UITableViewDataSource

extension ListViewController: UITableViewDataSource {
    // UITableViewDataSource conformance goes here
}

// MARK: UITableViewDelegate

extension ListViewController: UITableViewDelegate {
    // UITableViewDelegate conformance goes here
}
```

**Not Preferred:**

```swift
class ListViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegate {
    // class definition goes here
    // UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegate conformance goes here
}
```


### Singleton

When implementing the singleton pattern use a nested struct to leverage its static constant as a class constant.

```swift
class SensorManager {
    // MARK: - Properties

    class var sharedInstance: SensorManager {
        struct Singleton {
            static let instance = SensorManager()
        }

        return Singleton.instance
    }
}
```


## Control Flow

### For Loops

Prefer the `for-in` loop over the traditional C-Style `for` loop with a condition and an incrementer.

**Preferred:**

```swift
for _ in 0..<3 {
    println("Hello three times")
}

for (index, value) in enumerate(shoppingList) {
    println("Item \(index + 1): \(value)")
}
```

**Not Preferred:**

```swift
for var i = 0; i < 3; i++ {
    println("Hello three times")
}

for var i = 0; i < shoppingList.count; i++ {
    let item = shoppingList[i]
    println("Item \(i + 1): \(item)")
}
```


## Closure Expressions

Use trailing closure syntax wherever possible. Only use the provided shorthand argument names (`$0, $1, ...`) to refer to the values of the closure's arguments when the context provides an unambiguous assignment. Otherwise give the closure parameters descriptive names.

```swift
someFunctionThatTakesAClosure‚Äã() {
    // trailing closure's body goes here
‚Äã}

UIView.animateWithDuration(1.0, animations: {
    // animation code goes here
    }) { finished in
        // completion code goes here
    }
```

Omit the the `return` keyword in single-expression closures:

```swift
‚Äãreversed‚Äã = ‚Äãsorted‚Äã(‚Äãnames‚Äã) { ‚Äã$0‚Äã > ‚Äã$1‚Äã }
```
